                Tip: Try a watered-down lassi or some coconut water, it will keep you hydrated and are recommended period foods.

                One of the main drinks you need to avoid during your period, because caffeine is a stimuant, which leads to a fluctuation in your hormones. It increases blood pressure and heart rate leading to tension and anxiety attacks and in turn, worsening the PMS symptoms. Tip: Have green tea, tomato and carrot juice, or any type of soup instead. These are some of the foods to eat during a period to avoid cramps.

                Frozen foods, fast foods, bacon, pickles, canned soups, papad etc. come with unknown ingredients and preservatives that aren’t the best foods during your period. They can interfere with hormones and amplify PMS discomfort, and is best avoided during and a few days before your period.Tip: Have homemade meals, lots of salads and veggies, and heart and tummy-warming foods like khichadi and porridge.
