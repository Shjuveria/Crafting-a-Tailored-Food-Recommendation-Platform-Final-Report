                Period cramps are caused by contractions in your uterus. These contractions are triggered by changes in your body’s hormone levels, particularly prostaglandins. When you menstruate, your uterus contracts and sheds its lining, which is released as blood through your vagina.

                Using a heated patch or wrap on your abdomen can help relax the muscles of your uterus. It’s these muscles that cause period cramps. Heat can also boost circulation in your abdomen, which can reduce pain. Electric heating pads and hot water bottles aren’t as convenient to use as patches, but they’re good choices if you’re spending some time at home and don’t need to move around much.

                Oils that seem to be most effective at reducing period cramps include:

               lavender
               sage
               rose
               marjoram
               cinnamon
               clove
               Before using essential oils, you’ll want to mix them with a carrier oil, like coconut oil or jojoba oil.

                Soaking in a hot bath is another way to surround your abdominal, pelvic, and back muscles with the warmth they need to relieve muscle pain.
                You can enhance the pain-relieving power of a good soak by adding a few drops of essential oils — like lavender, sage, or rose — mixed with a carrier oil to your bathwater. Adding Epsom salt may also help relieve muscle pain.
                Try to relax in a hot bath for at least 15 minutes to get the most benefit from it.
