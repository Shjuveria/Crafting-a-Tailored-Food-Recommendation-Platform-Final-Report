            <h2>Exercises for Cramps Relief</h2>
            <p>
               When you are plagued with cramps, bloating and fatigue, the last thing you might want to do is work out. Movement during menstruation won’t just distract you from the discomfort; it can have some more concrete benefits such as decreased pain, soreness, cramping, and inflammation. 
            </p>

            <h4>Luckily, that doesn’t mean you need to go hard in the gym or hit the pavement for a half marathon. Instead, look to movement that properly engages your muscles and nourishes the entire body—like the four moves below.</h4>

            <div class="single-instruction">
              <header>
                <p>Low back and glute stretch</p>
                <div></div>
              </header>
              <p>
                The move: Start with the left foot flat, and right foot directly back from the hip at 6 o’clock. Plant the ball of the back foot like you’re wearing a stiletto heel and slightly bend the front knee. The left arm is going to reach straight out at shoulder height while the right arm reaches overhead. Sway the hips to the right as you reach up and out with the right hand. Repeat 6-8 times on both sides.
              </p>

                <p>Kneeling abdominal twist</p>
                <div></div>
              </header>
              <p>
                The move: Kneel on the left leg with the right foot planted at 3 o’clock, externally rotated. Interlace the fingers at chest height, lift elbows, and pull the fingers apart to engage the back. Shift your weight into the right foot, finding a deeper bend in the right knee as you drive the left elbow toward the left and twist. Return to center by engaging the glute and driving the right elbow back to square the shoulders forward. Repeat 6-8 times on both sides.
            </p>

                <div></div>
              </header>
              <p>
                The move: Lying down, bend the knees so both feet are planted flat on the floor about 6 inches from the glutes. Reach your fingertips toward your heels, engaging the upper back and opening the chest. Press into the feet and hover the pelvis 1-2 inches above your mat. Engage the glutes and press the pelvis toward the ceiling to find full range in the front of the hips and return to that hover. Repeat for 8-10 reps.

              <p class="single-tool">The benefit: This move can help alleviate some of the tightness that may develop in your muscles from period cramping and bloating. Here, you’ll open up the outer hips, ribs, abdominals, and back.</p>
              <p class="single-tool">The benefit: Hip and pelvic opening stretches can feel great when you are feeling tightness and fullness in this area, which can occur if you experience heavy bleeding, cramping, or PMS.</p>
